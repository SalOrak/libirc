# IRC P2P version?


IRC in a client-server architecture, like HTTP. Maybe there could be a client-server version of it, one that acts both as a client and a server expanding its limits.

So, the protocol is self-sustainable without the need of more than just 1 server. I'm not sure about this but as IRC is "as free as possible" I don't see why not adopting this model is not good enough.

Also, there should be a way to make the server store data to be retransmitted afterwards, in turn, creating a distributed client-server mesh of IRC clients and servers sharing all data altogether.  With this implementation users could store fragments of information that can be distributed afterwards. You can think about it as a torrent but for chatting.
